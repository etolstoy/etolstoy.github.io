title: About

I'm a passionate software developer from Moscow, Russia. Besides iOS development I spend a lot of time learning and sharing my knowledge by articles, public speaking and mentoring.

I'm lucky to work in a great team of talented developers at [Avito](https://github.com/avito-tech). I spread my attitude towards the importance of Open Source and community evolving among them and other Moscow mobile developers. One of its outcomes is a [regular podcast Podlodka](https://soundcloud.com/podlodka), where we share our experience in architecture, engineering practices, lifehacks and other aspects of development.
