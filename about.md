I'm a passionate software developer from Moscow, Russia. Besides iOS development I spend a lot of time learning and sharing my knowledge by articles, public speaking and mentoring.

I'm lucky to work in a great team of talented developers at [Avito](https://github.com/avito-tech). I spread my attitude towards the importance of Open Source and community evolving among them and other Moscow mobile developers. One of its outcomes was a [regular meetup](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7JJcdGH5aCFg8XcsyNfxL4mSOv9lBw5d) held in Rambler&Co Moscow office, where we shared our experience in architecture, patterns, code style and other aspects of mobile development.
